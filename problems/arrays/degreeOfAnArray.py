'''
Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers nums, the degree of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.

Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, that has the same degree as nums.

rephrase: 
    given nums
    degree = max_freq of element -> if 3 has a freq of 5 and its the highest freq, then degree = 5
    goal=smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, that has the same degree as nums.


Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1]
Output: 2
The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.
Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]
The shortest length is 2. So return 2.

tasks:
    - get the degree of nums ( the number(num) with highest freq(k))
    - given that degree, find the smallest window in which we can find k times num
    - return length of that window

nums = [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 7, 5, 5]
n = 5, k =4
goal= find a window with four 5s
two pointers (l, r), start from 0, 0
if both of these pointers are different from num, increase both
the goal is that l starts from the very first occurrence of num
expand pointer r while k > 0, decrement k as we find num
return r-l


Time: O(n * k), where n is the number of distinct numbers in the array, and k is the number of total elements in the array
Space: O(2 k) -> O(k), where k is the number of total elements in the array
