'''
Given an integer array nums, find three numbers whose product is maximum and return the maximum product.

nums = [4, 3, 5, 9, 10, 2]

ans = 9*10*5
 what if we have two very large negative numbers and one very large positive?

 nums = [-5, -4, -1, 0, 1, 4, 5]
 ans = -5*-4*5
 ans = 100

brute force: triple nested for loop. Not optimal since its time is O(n^3)

sort the array, maxProduct will be the maximum value of: 
    - the product of the three largest nums
    or
    - the product of the two smallest values and the largest

Time: O(nlgn) as we have to sort the array
Space: O(1) if we dont consider the input
