'''
You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. 

The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

if n = 6

rows = [1, 2, 3]
ans = 3

if n = 5
rows = [1, 2, 2]
ans = 2 because the third row is not complete

start at 1. while n > 0, add a new row using the following rules:
    - if n >= rows[i-1]+1 
        rows[i] = rows[i-1]+1
        totalRows+=1
        n-=rows[i]
    - else:
         rows[i] = n
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
I came up with the first solution, watched a video after to see the math formula behind it
