'''
You are given an m x n matrix board containing letters 'X' and 'O', capture regions that are surrounded:

Connect: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
Region: To form a region connect every 'O' cell.
Surround: The region is surrounded with 'X' cells if you can connect the region with 'X' cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the board.
A surrounded region is captured by replacing all 'O's with 'X's in the input matrix board.

repharase problem: 
    given an mxn matrix containing of Xs and Os, 
    find each surrounded region(set of adjacent cells horizontally or vertically) of Os that cannot be on the edges
    explore each region. If the region is fully surrounded with X's, mark that region as surrounded
    once you explore all regions, traverse the surrounded ones and turn the Os to Xs
    return the grid
